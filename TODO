- Develop SVM / CNN (Local/Edge Impulse)
- merge all

# SVM Specific -- [AMIR]
- Separate data into training and testing
- Get function to convert from wav to ftt
- Normalize each feature so that they are between -1 and 1 with mean=0
- Train SVM
- Test SVM
- Plot results
- Tune Hyperparameters
- Decide which kernel fun to use
- Implement SVM in C with the weights from python SVM
- Test SVM in C
# less important
- Try dimentionality reduction (prolly with PCA) and test the results


# SVM Specific -- [Stefano],[Andy]
# helpful but not necessary
- Get recordings from the MSP for fine tuning
