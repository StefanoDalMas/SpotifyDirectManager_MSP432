TODO final
- read interrupts from both joystick and buttons correctly
- set up LCD screen with Spotify logo (top right corner), metadata (Author and song's name), possible play state
- merge EdgeImpulse's CNN (and remove either buttons or joystick functionalities)
- clean up code
- prepare video
- prepare readme file with everything needed


optional:
- clean UART "protocol" lol
- PPT presentation or something like that to explain
